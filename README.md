# Stock-Price-Predicition

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use historical stock data to predict future stock prices through machine learning.
We apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple regression models to forecast prices and evaluate their accuracy.

Features
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, datetime conversion, sorting)
Feature Engineering with popular technical indicators:
Lag Features (Close_lag_X)
Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Rolling Standard Deviation
Rolling Volume Sum
Volume Change and Volume Ratio
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Bollinger Bands
On-Balance Volume (OBV)
Linear Regression baseline model
Model evaluation with Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Insightful metrics for training and testing datasets
